## What is Pingora (Nginx Alternative)
Pingora is a Rust framework to [build fast, reliable and programmable networked systems](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pingora-open-source).

Pingora is battle tested as it has been serving more than 40 million Internet requests per second for [more than a few years](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet).

## Feature highlights
* Async Rust: fast and reliable
* HTTP 1/2 end to end proxy
* TLS over OpenSSL or BoringSSL
* gRPC and websocket proxying
* Graceful reload
* Customizable load balancing and failover strategies
* Support for a variety of observability tools

## Reasons to use Pingora
* **Security** is your top priority: Pingora is a more memory safe alternative for services that are written in C/C++.
* Your service is **performance-sensitive**: Pingora is fast and efficient.
* Your service requires extensive **customization**: The APIs Pingora proxy framework provides are highly programmable.

# System requirements

## Systems
Linux is our tier 1 environment and main focus.

We will try our best for most code to compile for Unix environments. This is for developers and users to have an easier time developing with Pingora in Unix-like environments like macOS (though some features might be missing)

Both x86_64 and aarch64 architectures will be supported.

## Rust version

Pingora keeps a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) policy of 6 months. This means we will accept PRs that upgrade the MSRV as long as the new Rust version used is at least 6 months old.

Our current MSRV is 1.72.

## Build Requirements

Some of the crates in this repository have dependencies on additional tools and
libraries that must be satisfied in order to build them:

* Make sure that [Clang] is installed on your system (for boringssl)
* Make sure that [Perl 5] is installed on your system (for openssl)

[Clang]:https://clang.llvm.org/
[Perl 5]:https://www.perl.org/
